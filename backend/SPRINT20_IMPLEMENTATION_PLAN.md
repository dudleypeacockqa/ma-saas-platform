- [ ] User authentication and registration working
- [ ] Deal management CRUD operations complete
- [ ] Frontend-backend integration functional
- [ ] No critical errors in health checks
- [ ] Sprint 17 failures resolved (>80% success rate)

### Should Have (Production Ready)

- [ ] Document processing functional
- [ ] Advanced analytics working
- [ ] All user permissions enforced
- [ ] Performance within acceptable limits
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling

### Could Have (Enhanced UX)

- [ ] Real-time updates working
- [ ] Advanced search functionality
- [ ] Notification system active
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified

## Technical Debt & Risks

### High Risk Items

1. **Integration Engine Complexity**: May require significant refactoring
2. **Redis Dependencies**: Missing infrastructure may cause cascading failures
3. **Frontend State Management**: Redux store may need updates
4. **Database Performance**: Large dataset operations may be slow

### Mitigation Strategies

- Focus on core functionality first
- Use feature flags for complex features
- Implement graceful degradation
- Create rollback plans for critical changes

## Verification Strategy

### Automated Tests

- Unit tests for critical business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for user workflows
- Performance tests for key operations

### Manual Testing

- Complete user registration and login flow
- Create and manage deals end-to-end
- Upload and process documents
- Test organization management
- Verify billing integration

### Deployment Testing

- Health check endpoints
- Database connectivity
- External service integration
- Security header validation
