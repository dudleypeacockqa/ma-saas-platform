## 3. Multi-Tenant Architecture

### 3.1 Tenant Isolation Strategy

The platform implements a shared database, shared schema multi-tenancy model with organization-based data isolation. Each database table includes an `organization_id` column that ensures complete data separation between tenants while maintaining cost efficiency and operational simplicity.

**Data Isolation**: All queries include organization context to prevent cross-tenant data access. Database-level constraints and application-level validation ensure data integrity and security.

**Resource Sharing**: Compute resources, application instances, and database connections are shared across tenants to optimize costs while maintaining performance isolation through proper resource management.

**Scalability**: The architecture supports horizontal scaling by adding database read replicas and application instances as tenant count and usage grow.

### 3.2 Organization Management

**Organization Creation**: New organizations are created during user registration or through admin invitation processes. Each organization receives a unique identifier that serves as the primary tenant key.

**User Association**: Users belong to one or more organizations with specific roles and permissions. The system supports multiple organization membership for users who work across different firms.

**Data Partitioning**: Large tables can be partitioned by organization_id to maintain query performance as data volume grows. This approach ensures consistent performance regardless of tenant size.

### 3.3 Security and Compliance

**Access Control**: All API endpoints validate organization membership before processing requests. Users can only access data belonging to their authorized organizations.

**Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails track all data access and modifications with organization context for compliance and security monitoring.

**Data Encryption**: All data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption and in transit using TLS 1.3. Encryption keys are managed through cloud provider key management services.

## 4. Database Design

### 4.1 Core Data Models

**User Management Schema**
The user management system supports multi-organization membership with role-based permissions. Users authenticate through Clerk and are associated with organizations through membership records that define their access levels and permissions.

**Organization Schema**
Organizations represent tenant boundaries in the system. Each organization has subscription information, configuration settings, and associated users. The organization model includes billing details, feature flags, and usage tracking.

**Deal Management Schema**
Deals are the core business objects in the system. Each deal belongs to an organization and includes comprehensive information about M&A transactions including parties, financial details, timeline, and current status.

**Document Management Schema**
Documents are stored with metadata in the database while file content is stored in cloud storage. The document model includes version tracking, access permissions, and audit trails for compliance requirements.

**Podcast Management Schema**
The podcast system includes models for podcast shows, episodes, and analytics. This unique feature differentiates the platform and provides content marketing capabilities for customer acquisition.

### 4.2 Performance Optimization

**Indexing Strategy**
Comprehensive indexing on organization_id, user_id, and frequently queried fields ensures optimal query performance. Composite indexes support complex queries while minimizing index maintenance overhead.

**Query Optimization**
All queries are optimized for multi-tenant access patterns. Database query plans are regularly analyzed and optimized to maintain sub-200ms response times as data volume grows.

**Connection Pooling**
Database connection pooling with appropriate sizing ensures efficient resource utilization while supporting concurrent user loads. Connection pools are monitored and tuned based on usage patterns.

### 4.3 Data Migration and Backup

**Migration Management**
Alembic provides version-controlled database schema migrations with rollback capabilities. All schema changes are tested in staging environments before production deployment.

**Backup Strategy**
Automated daily backups with 30-day retention provide data protection and disaster recovery capabilities. Point-in-time recovery enables restoration to any point within the retention period.

**Disaster Recovery**
Comprehensive disaster recovery procedures include database replication, automated failover, and documented recovery processes to ensure business continuity.
