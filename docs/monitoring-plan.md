# Monitoring & Alerting Plan

## Error Tracking
- Tool: Sentry (frontend + backend)
- Setup: add SENTRY_DSN secrets in GitHub and Render
- Instrumentation:
  - Frontend: initialize Sentry inside rontend/src/main.tsx
  - Backend: add Sentry middleware in FastAPI (ackend/app/main.py)
- Alerts: trigger Slack #alerts & PagerDuty when critical error rate exceeds threshold

## Performance Monitoring
- Tool: Datadog APM (or New Relic)
- Metrics:
  - API latency (p50/p90/p99), throughput, error rate
  - Frontend Web Vitals (TTFB, LCP, FID, CLS)
  - Background worker queue depth, job failure rate
- Dashboards & SLOs:
  - API p95 < 300?ms
  - LCP < 2.5?s for main pages
  - Uptime = 99.9%

## Logging
- Structured JSON logs via structlog (backend) and browser console interceptors (frontend)
- Aggregate into Logtail/ELK; retain =30?days
- Include request IDs/correlation IDs across services

## Synthetic Monitoring
- Pingdom/UptimeRobot probing /health endpoints every 60?s
- Daily Playwright synthetic journeys (login, trial signup, checkout, analytics)

## Business KPIs
- GA4 + Segment feeding Looker Studio/Metabase
- Track MRR, CAC, LTV, churn, trial?paid conversion, active users, feature adoption
- Alerts: MRR drop >5% WoW, churn +2 pts, conversion < targets

## Incident Response
- PagerDuty rotations (engineering & CS)
- Runbooks stored in Confluence/Notion
- Postmortems aligned with BMAD loop (Build ? Measure ? Analyze ? Deliver) generating remediation backlog

## Security Monitoring
- Dependabot/Snyk scans in CI
- Render/Cloudflare WAF + rate limiting with anomaly alerts
- SOC2/ISO controls tracked via Drata/Vanta dashboards

## Deployment Integration
- CI requires Sentry/Datadog secrets on protected branches
- Deploy workflow posts status + dashboard links to monitoring channel
