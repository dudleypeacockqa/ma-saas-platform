## Critical Updates Available (October 12, 2025)

### 1. **NEW: Brownfield Document-Project Workflow** ‚≠ê

**Commit**: "brownfield document project workflow added to analyst"
**Impact**: HIGH - Directly addresses your M&A platform brownfield documentation needs

**What It Does**:

- Comprehensive brownfield codebase analysis and documentation
- Scans existing code to generate PRD-style documentation
- Three scan levels: Quick (2-5 min), Deep (10-30 min), Exhaustive (30-120 min)
- Generates Architecture.md, source tree documentation, component inventories
- Write-as-you-go approach prevents context exhaustion
- Resumable workflow for large projects

**Why You Need This**:
Your [bmad/bmm/workflows/README.md](bmad/bmm/workflows/README.md:218-230) mentions brownfield analysis is "coming soon" and shows:

```
plan-project (Phase 2)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí NO: HALT with message:
        "Brownfield project requires documentation.
         Please run codebase-analysis workflow first."
         ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí [TBD: brownfield-analysis workflow]  ‚Üê THIS IS NOW AVAILABLE
```

**Recommendation**: **HIGH PRIORITY** - Pull this workflow immediately. Your platform has significant existing code that would benefit from systematic documentation.

### 2. **CHANGE: Analyze Workflow Split**

**Commit**: "split analyze workflow"
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Better workflow organization

**What Changed**:

- Analysis phase workflows have been reorganized/split
- Likely improves modularity and maintainability
- May affect how you invoke analysis workflows

**Recommendation**: Review the new structure to understand if any of your existing workflow invocations need updating.

### 3. **UPDATE: Minor Dev Agent Updates**

**Commit**: "minor dev agent updates"
**Impact**: LOW-MEDIUM - Incremental improvements

**What Changed**:

- Small improvements to the Developer agent
- Likely bug fixes or minor enhancements
- Should be backward compatible

### 4. **STRUCTURAL: Removed bmad Folder**

**Commit**: "removed bmad folder"
**Impact**: LOW - Internal repository cleanup

**What Changed**:

- Repository structure cleanup
- Doesn't affect your installed version
- May affect future update procedures

**Recommendation**: No action needed for current installation.

## Integration Strategy for Brownfield Workflow

Since the **document-project workflow** is the most valuable update, here's a detailed integration plan:

### Step 1: Pull the Workflow (30 min)

```bash
# From the official v6-alpha repository
# Copy src/modules/bmm/workflows/1-analysis/document-project/
# To your bmad/bmm/workflows/1-analysis/document-project/
```

### Step 2: Verify Integration (30 min)

- Check workflow.yaml compatibility
- Verify agent references
- Test workflow invocation
- Validate output paths

### Step 3: Run Initial Analysis (2-4 hours)

- Start with Quick scan of your backend
- Review generated documentation
- Run Deep scan on critical components
- Generate comprehensive baseline

### Step 4: Update Planning Workflow (1 hour)

Your [bmad/bmm/workflows/README.md](bmad/bmm/workflows/README.md:218-230) needs updating:

```markdown
# Change from:

[TBD: brownfield-analysis workflow]

# To:

‚úÖ Available: document-project workflow
‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Analyzes existing codebase
‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Documents current architecture
‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Identifies technical debt
‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Creates baseline documentation
```

### Expected Benefits:

1. **Complete Baseline**: Comprehensive documentation of existing platform
2. **Better Planning**: Informed epic planning with full context
3. **Tech Debt Visibility**: Systematic identification of improvement areas
4. **Onboarding Aid**: Better documentation for team/AI context
5. **Architecture Understanding**: Clear map of current system state

## V6-Alpha Stability Assessment

**Alpha Characteristics**:
