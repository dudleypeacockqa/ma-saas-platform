# Project Workflow Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Project:** 100 Days and Beyond - M&A Ecosystem Platform
**Analyst:** BMad User

## Assessment Results

### Project Classification

- **Project Type:** Enterprise SaaS Platform
- **Project Level:** Level 3
- **Instruction Set:** instructions-lg (Full PRD with architect handoff)

### Scope Summary

- **Brief Description:** Comprehensive M&A ecosystem platform with AI-powered deal management, document processing, community features, and multi-tenant architecture. Dual-purpose platform serving personal wealth building and SaaS revenue generation.
- **Estimated Stories:** 25-35 stories
- **Estimated Epics:** 4 epics
- **Timeline:** 120 days to GTM launch (4 months)

### Context

- **Greenfield/Brownfield:** Greenfield (new development with Phase 1 infrastructure complete)
- **Existing Documentation:** Product Brief complete, technical architecture foundation, market research available
- **Team Size:** Solo founder with AI assistance, part-time contractors post-revenue
- **Deployment Intent:** Production SaaS application with multi-tenant capabilities

## Recommended Workflow Path

### Primary Outputs

1. **PRD.md** - Comprehensive Product Requirements Document with functional/non-functional requirements
2. **epics.md** - Detailed epic breakdown with user stories and acceptance criteria
3. **architecture.md** - Solution architecture (via separate workflow)
4. **ux-specification.md** - UX/UI specifications (recommended for user-facing platform)

### Workflow Sequence

1. Complete PRD generation with Level 3 instructions
2. Define 4 epics covering core platform capabilities
3. Execute architecture workflow for technical design
4. Generate UX specifications for user interface
5. Create detailed user stories from epics
6. Begin sprint planning and implementation

### Next Actions

1. Continue with PRD generation using product brief input
2. Define comprehensive functional requirements (12-20 FRs)
3. Map user journeys for key personas
4. Structure epics for phased delivery
5. Handoff to architect for solution design

## Special Considerations

- **AI Integration Priority:** Claude Code MCP integration is a core differentiator requiring early architecture focus
- **Multi-tenant from Day 1:** Architecture must support tenant isolation and scaling
- **Bootstrap Constraints:** Design for cost-efficiency and rapid development
- **Community Features:** Network effects are critical for competitive moat
- **Dual Purpose Model:** Platform serves both personal M&A activities and SaaS customers

## Technical Preferences Captured

- **Frontend:** React with TypeScript (confirmed in product brief)
- **Backend:** Python FastAPI (confirmed in product brief)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (confirmed in product brief)
- **AI Integration:** Claude Code MCP Server (core requirement)
- **Deployment:** Render platform (Phase 1 complete)
- **Development Methodology:** BMAD with AI assistance
