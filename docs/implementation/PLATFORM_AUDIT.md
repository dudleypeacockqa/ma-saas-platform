# M&A SaaS Platform Audit: "100 Days and Beyond"

**Date**: October 8, 2025

## 1. Executive Summary

This audit provides a comprehensive assessment of the current implementation status of the "100 Days and Beyond" M&A SaaS platform. The review identifies significant gaps between the planned architecture and the actual implemented code. The platform currently consists of a basic FastAPI backend, a static HTML website, and several markdown documents outlining the intended design. Key features such as multi-tenancy, a functional subscription system, and a self-hosted podcast solution are not yet implemented.

This document outlines the identified gaps in detail and proposes a clear action plan to address these discrepancies. The audit serves as a foundational document for the next phase of development, which will focus on building a robust, scalable, and commercially viable platform that aligns with the user's vision and bootstrap budget.

## 2. Audit Findings

### 2.1. Backend and Database

**Finding**: The backend is a standard FastAPI project with no evidence of a multi-tenant architecture. The database connection is configured, but the schema does not support multiple tenants. The current implementation is not suitable for a SaaS application that needs to serve multiple customers with isolated data.

**Gap**: The platform lacks a multi-tenant database schema and the necessary application logic to manage tenant-specific data. This is a critical architectural flaw that prevents the platform from being sold as a subscription service.

**Action Plan**:

1.  **Redesign Database Schema**: Implement a multi-tenant database schema using a standard approach such as schema-per-tenant or a shared schema with a tenant identifier.
2.  **Implement Tenant Management**: Develop the application logic to create, manage, and isolate tenants.
3.  **Refactor Backend Code**: Refactor the existing backend code to support the multi-tenant architecture.

### 2.2. Subscription System

**Finding**: The Clerk integration is incomplete. While two subscription plans have been created in the Clerk dashboard, the backend does not have the necessary logic to handle subscription events, feature gating, or billing.

**Gap**: The platform cannot currently manage subscriptions, which is a core requirement for a SaaS business. The pricing structure also needs to be updated to reflect the user's new pricing model.

**Action Plan**:

1.  **Update Pricing**: Update the subscription plans in the Clerk dashboard to the new pricing: $279/month (Solo), $798/month (Growth), and $1598/month (Enterprise).
2.  **Implement Webhooks**: Implement webhook handlers to process subscription events from Clerk (e.g., `subscription.created`, `subscription.updated`, `subscription.deleted`).
3.  **Implement Feature Gating**: Develop the logic to control access to features based on the user's subscription plan.

### 2.3. Website and Frontend

**Finding**: The website is a collection of static HTML files. It is not a modern, interactive frontend application. The blog and podcast pages are simple HTML pages and are not integrated with a content management system (CMS).

**Gap**: The website does not provide a professional user experience and is not scalable for future growth. It lacks the necessary features to support a SaaS application, such as a user dashboard, account management, and billing information.

**Action Plan**:

1.  **Develop a React Frontend**: Build a modern, interactive frontend application using React.
2.  **Implement User Dashboard**: Create a user dashboard that allows users to manage their account, subscriptions, and access the platform's features.
3.  **Integrate with Backend**: Integrate the frontend with the backend API to fetch data and perform actions.

### 2.4. Podcast Hosting

**Finding**: The current plan is to use a paid podcast hosting service (Captivate.fm). This does not align with the user's bootstrap budget.

**Gap**: The reliance on a paid service for a core feature is not sustainable for a bootstrapped startup. A self-hosted solution is required to minimize operational costs.

**Action Plan**:

1.  **Build a Self-Hosted Podcast Solution**: Develop a custom podcast hosting solution that includes an RSS feed generator and audio file storage.
2.  **Integrate with Website**: Integrate the self-hosted podcast solution with the website to display podcast episodes and the RSS feed.

### 2.5. AI Agent Development

**Finding**: The AI agent development has not progressed beyond creating a placeholder file. The Claude Code CLI setup was problematic, and no functional code has been written.

**Gap**: The platform is missing a key differentiator and value proposition. The AI-powered agents are a critical feature for automating M&A workflows and providing data-driven insights.

**Action Plan**:

1.  **Resolve CLI Issues**: Troubleshoot and resolve the issues with the Claude Code CLI.
2.  **Implement Deal Sourcing Agent**: Develop the "Deal Sourcing Agent" to automate the process of identifying potential M&A targets.
3.  **Plan for Future Agents**: Create a roadmap for developing additional AI agents to automate other M&A workflows.

## 3. Revised Project Plan

Based on the audit findings, the project plan has been revised to focus on addressing the identified gaps. The new plan prioritizes the development of a functional, multi-tenant SaaS platform with a self-hosted podcast solution. The updated phases are as follows:

1.  **Phase 1: Audit current platform implementation and identify gaps** (Completed)
2.  **Phase 2: Fix backend database connections and multi-tenant architecture**
3.  **Phase 3: Update pricing structure and fix subscription integration**
4.  **Phase 4: Build self-hosted podcast RSS system**
5.  **Phase 5: Complete website frontend and ensure full functionality**
6.  **Phase 6: Deliver working platform with comprehensive documentation**

## 4. Conclusion

This audit has revealed critical gaps between the planned and actual implementation of the "100 Days and Beyond" M&A SaaS platform. The platform is not yet a commercially viable product. The revised project plan provides a clear path forward for building a robust and scalable platform that meets the user's requirements. The next phase of development will focus on implementing a multi-tenant architecture, a functional subscription system, and a self-hosted podcast solution. These are the foundational elements that will enable the platform to be sold as a subscription service and generate revenue.
