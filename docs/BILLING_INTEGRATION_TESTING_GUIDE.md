# Billing Integration Testing Guide

This guide outlines the complete testing process for the Clerk + Stripe billing integration implemented in the M&A SaaS Platform.

## Overview

The billing integration includes:

- Clerk authentication with user management

## API Endpoint Testing

### Test Backend Endpoints Directly

Using tools like Postman, cURL, or Bruno:

**1. Get Current Subscription**

```bash
GET /api/payments/subscription/current
Headers: Authorization: Bearer {clerk_jwt_token}

Expected: 200 OK with subscription data or 404 if no subscription
```

**2. Create Checkout Session**

```bash
POST /api/payments/checkout-session
Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer {clerk_jwt_token}
  Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{
  "price_id": "price_solo_dealmaker",
  "success_url": "http://localhost:5173/subscription/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}",
  "cancel_url": "http://localhost:5173/subscription/cancel",
  "mode": "subscription"
}

Expected: 200 OK with session_url
```

**3. Create Portal Session**

```bash
POST /api/payments/portal-session
Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer {clerk_jwt_token}
  Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{
  "return_url": "http://localhost:5173/subscription"
}

Expected: 200 OK with portal_url
```

**4. Webhook Handling**

```bash
POST /api/payments/webhook
Headers:
  Content-Type: application/json
  Stripe-Signature: {stripe_signature}
Body: {stripe_event_payload}

Expected: 200 OK
```

## Webhook Testing

### Using Stripe CLI

1. **Install Stripe CLI:**

   ```bash
   # Download from: https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli
   ```

2. **Login to Stripe:**

   ```bash
   stripe login
   ```

3. **Forward Webhooks to Local Backend:**

   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8000/api/payments/webhook
   ```

4. **Trigger Test Events:**

   ```bash
   # Test subscription created
   stripe trigger customer.subscription.created

   # Test subscription updated
   stripe trigger customer.subscription.updated

   # Test subscription deleted
   stripe trigger customer.subscription.deleted

   # Test payment succeeded
   stripe trigger invoice.payment_succeeded

   # Test payment failed
   stripe trigger invoice.payment_failed
   ```

5. **Verify Backend Logs:**
   - Check backend logs for webhook receipt
   - Verify database updates
   - Confirm user subscription records updated

## Error Scenarios

### Test Error Handling

**1. Invalid API Token:**

- Remove or corrupt authentication token
- Attempt API call
- Expected: 401 Unauthorized error

**2. Invalid Price ID:**

- Use non-existent price_id in checkout
- Expected: Proper error message displayed to user

**3. Network Failure:**

- Disconnect internet during checkout
- Expected: User-friendly error message, retry option

**4. Webhook Signature Failure:**

- Send webhook with invalid signature
- Expected: Backend rejects webhook (400 error)

**5. Expired Checkout Session:**

- Start checkout, wait 24+ hours
- Try to complete expired session
- Expected: Stripe shows error, user redirected back

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing Considerations

1. **Concurrent Checkouts:**
   - Multiple users initiating checkout simultaneously
   - Verify no race conditions

2. **Subscription API Response Time:**
   - Measure `/subscription/current` endpoint latency
   - Should respond within 500ms

3. **Webhook Processing:**
   - Verify webhooks processed quickly
   - Check for any blocking operations
