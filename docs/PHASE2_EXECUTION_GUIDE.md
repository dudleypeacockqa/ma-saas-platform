    it('should create deal with valid data', async () => {
      const deal = await dealService.createDeal({
        name: 'Test Deal',
        value: 1000000,
        stage: 'prospecting',
      });

      expect(deal.id).toBeDefined();
      expect(deal.tenant_id).toBe(mockTenantId);
    });

    it('should validate required fields', async () => {
      await expect(dealService.createDeal({})).rejects.toThrow('Validation error');
    });
  });
});

// Integration Test Example
describe('Deal API', () => {
  it('should complete deal lifecycle', async () => {
    // Create
    const createRes = await request(app).post('/api/v1/deals').send(validDeal).expect(201);

    const dealId = createRes.body.id;

    // Read
    await request(app).get(`/api/v1/deals/${dealId}`).expect(200);

    // Update
    await request(app).patch(`/api/v1/deals/${dealId}`).send({ stage: 'negotiation' }).expect(200);

    // Delete
    await request(app).delete(`/api/v1/deals/${dealId}`).expect(204);
  });
});
```

## Integration Requirements

### Existing Integrations

#### Clerk Authentication

```typescript
// Extend for business features
import { useUser } from '@clerk/clerk-react';

const DealPage = () => {
  const { user } = useUser();

  // Multi-tenant context
  const tenantId = user.publicMetadata.tenantId;

  // Role-based access
  const canEdit = user.publicMetadata.role === 'admin';
};
```

#### PostgreSQL with RLS

```sql
-- Every table must have tenant isolation
ALTER TABLE deals ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON deals
  USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::UUID);
```

#### Render Deployment

```yaml
# render.yaml updates
services:
  - type: web
    name: ma-platform-api
    env: python
    buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt
    startCommand: uvicorn app.main:app
    envVars:
      - key: DATABASE_URL
        fromDatabase:
          name: ma-platform-db
          property: connectionString
```

### New Phase 2 Integrations

#### AWS S3 for Documents

```python
# Document storage service
from boto3 import client

class DocumentStorage:
    def __init__(self):
        self.s3 = client('s3',
            aws_access_key_id=settings.AWS_ACCESS_KEY,
            aws_secret_access_key=settings.AWS_SECRET_KEY
        )

    async def upload_document(self, file, deal_id: UUID):
        key = f"tenants/{tenant_id}/deals/{deal_id}/{file.filename}"

        # Upload with encryption
        self.s3.upload_fileobj(
            file.file,
            settings.S3_BUCKET,
            key,
            ExtraArgs={'ServerSideEncryption': 'AES256'}
        )

        return key
```

#### SendGrid for Notifications

```python
# Email service
from sendgrid import SendGridAPIClient

class EmailService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sg = SendGridAPIClient(settings.SENDGRID_API_KEY)

    async def send_deal_notification(self, user_email, deal_name):
        message = Mail(
            from_email='noreply@maplatform.com',
            to_emails=user_email,
            subject=f'New activity on {deal_name}',
            html_content=render_template('deal_activity.html')
        )

        await self.sg.send(message)
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                               | Impact | Mitigation                              | Owner      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Database performance degradation   | High   | Index optimization, query monitoring    | Backend    |
| WebSocket connection stability     | Medium | Fallback to polling, reconnection logic | Frontend   |
| File upload failures               | Medium | Chunked uploads, retry mechanism        | Full-stack |
| Third-party API downtime           | Low    | Circuit breakers, cached responses      | Backend    |
| Memory leaks in real-time features | Medium | Profiling, cleanup on unmount           | Frontend   |

### Mitigation Strategies

#### Database Performance

```python
# Query optimization
from sqlalchemy import select
from sqlalchemy.orm import selectinload

# Eager load relationships
query = select(Deal).options(
    selectinload(Deal.activities),
    selectinload(Deal.documents)
).where(Deal.tenant_id == tenant_id)

# Add query explanation in development
if settings.DEBUG:
    print(query.compile(compile_kwargs={"literal_binds": True}))
```

#### WebSocket Fallback

```typescript
// Graceful degradation
class RealtimeService {
  private useWebSocket = true;

  connect() {
    try {
      this.ws = new WebSocket(WS_URL);
      this.setupWebSocketHandlers();
    } catch (error) {
      console.warn('WebSocket failed, falling back to polling');
      this.useWebSocket = false;
      this.startPolling();
    }
  }

  private startPolling() {
    setInterval(async () => {
      const updates = await fetch('/api/v1/updates');
      this.handleUpdates(updates);
    }, 5000);
  }
}
```
