### 🏗️ Technical Architecture

#### **Database Schema**

```sql
-- Organizations (multi-tenancy)
organizations (

    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    subdomain VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    settings JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    subscription_tier VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'free',
    billing_info JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
);

-- Enhanced user profiles
user_profiles (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    organization_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id),
    role user_role_enum NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    bio TEXT,
    expertise JSONB DEFAULT '[]',
    experience_years INTEGER,
    education JSONB DEFAULT '[]',
    certifications JSONB DEFAULT '[]',
    preferences JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    avatar_url TEXT,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
);

-- Deal teams
deal_teams (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    deal_id UUID REFERENCES deals(id),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    role VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    assigned_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    assigned_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    permissions JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    is_lead BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
);

-- Organization invitations
organization_invitations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    organization_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id),

```

#### **Permission System**

```typescript
// Permission matrix for M&A platform
const PERMISSIONS = {
  DEALS: {
    CREATE: ['MANAGING_PARTNER', 'PARTNER'],
    READ: ['ALL_ROLES'],
    UPDATE: ['MANAGING_PARTNER', 'PARTNER', 'DIRECTOR'],
    DELETE: ['MANAGING_PARTNER', 'PARTNER'],
    ASSIGN_TEAM: ['MANAGING_PARTNER', 'PARTNER', 'DIRECTOR'],
  },
  DOCUMENTS: {
    UPLOAD: ['ALL_EXCEPT_CLIENT'],
    READ: ['TEAM_MEMBERS', 'CLIENT'], // Based on deal assignment
    DELETE: ['MANAGING_PARTNER', 'PARTNER', 'DIRECTOR'],
    SHARE_EXTERNAL: ['MANAGING_PARTNER', 'PARTNER'],
  },
  ANALYTICS: {
    VIEW_ORG: ['MANAGING_PARTNER', 'PARTNER'],
    VIEW_DEAL: ['TEAM_MEMBERS'],
    EXPORT: ['MANAGING_PARTNER', 'PARTNER', 'DIRECTOR'],
  },
  ADMIN: {
    MANAGE_USERS: ['MANAGING_PARTNER'],
    BILLING: ['MANAGING_PARTNER', 'PARTNER'],
