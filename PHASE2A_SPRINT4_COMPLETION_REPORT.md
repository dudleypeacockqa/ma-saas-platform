## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Details

### Production Integration Testing Architecture

```python
class ProductionIntegrationTester:
    """Production-level integration testing framework"""

    def test_integration_categories(self):
        # 9 comprehensive integration test categories
        return {
            'database': self.test_database_connection(),
            'claude_ai': self.test_claude_ai_integration(),
            'storage': self.test_storage_integration(),
            'authentication': self.test_authentication_integration(),
            'payments': self.test_payment_integration(),
            'email': self.test_email_integration(),
            'cache': self.test_redis_integration(),
            'ai_services': self.test_ai_services_integration(),
            'core_services': self.test_core_services_with_integrations()
        }
```

### Multi-Tenant Data Scoping Pattern

```python
# All data models implement organization scoping
class FinancialStatement(BaseModel):
    organization_id = Column(UUID, ForeignKey('organizations.id'), nullable=False)
    # ... other fields

# All services support organization-scoped operations
def upload_document(self, file: BinaryIO, filename: str, organization_id: str):
    # Organization-scoped file paths: /org/{organization_id}/deals/{deal_id}/
    storage_path = f"organizations/{organization_id}/documents/{filename}"
```

### Configuration Detection System

```python
def detect_production_credentials(self):
    """Detect whether real production credentials are configured"""
    real_credentials = {
        'claude': os.getenv('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY') != 'sk-ant-your-anthropic-api-key-here',
        'r2': os.getenv('R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID') != 'development-test-key-id',
        'stripe': os.getenv('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY') != 'sk_live_your-stripe-secret-key-here'
    }
    return real_credentials
```
