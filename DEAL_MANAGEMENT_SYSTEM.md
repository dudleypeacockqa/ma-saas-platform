**Frontend:**

- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components
- React Hook Form with Zod validation

## 🚀 Next Steps

To complete the integration:

1. **Add Routing**:

   ```tsx
   // Example App.tsx routes
   <Route path="/deals" element={<DealPipeline />} />
   <Route path="/deals/:dealId" element={<DealDetail />} />
   <Route path="/deals/analytics" element={<DealAnalytics />} />
   <Route path="/deals/compare" element={<DealComparison />} />
   ```

2. **Run Database Migrations**:

   ```bash
   # Create migration for new Deal models
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add comprehensive deal models"
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

3. **Update Main Router**:

   ```python
   # backend/app/main.py
   from app.routers import deals
   app.include_router(deals.router)
   ```

4. **Configure Environment**:

   ```
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
   ```

5. **Test the System**:
   - Create a few sample deals
   - Test drag-and-drop in pipeline
   - Add activities, documents, valuations
   - View analytics
   - Compare deals
