# Document Sharding & Context Engineering 📄

## Overview

Advanced document management for large architectural documents, PRDs, and technical specifications. Breaks down massive documents into focused, contextual chunks that optimize AI agent performance and knowledge retrieval.

## Purpose

- **Context Optimization**: Keep AI agents focused on relevant information
- **Knowledge Management**: Organize complex documentation for easy retrieval
- **Collaboration**: Enable multiple agents to work on different document sections
- **Version Control**: Track changes across document fragments

## Available Commands

### 🔪 shard-document

**Description**: Break large documents into focused sections based on content structure
**Usage**: Shard my large architectural document into manageable pieces

### 🗂️ organize-knowledge

**Description**: Organize sharded documents into logical hierarchies for agent consumption
**Usage**: Organize my documentation fragments for optimal agent access

### 🔍 create-index

**Description**: Create searchable index of document fragments with metadata
**Usage**: Index my sharded documents for quick retrieval

### 🔄 merge-updates

**Description**: Consolidate changes from multiple document fragments
**Usage**: Merge updates from different teams working on document sections

### 📊 analyze-structure

**Description**: Analyze document structure and recommend optimal sharding strategy
**Usage**: Analyze my document to determine the best sharding approach

## Document Types for Sharding

### Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)

- **Executive Summary**: Business context and objectives
- **Feature Specifications**: Detailed feature descriptions
- **User Stories**: Individual story breakdowns
- **Technical Requirements**: System constraints and dependencies
- **Success Metrics**: KPIs and measurement criteria

### Architecture Documents

- **System Overview**: High-level architecture patterns
- **Data Models**: Entity relationships and database schemas
- **API Specifications**: Endpoint definitions and contracts
- **Security Design**: Authentication, authorization, encryption
- **Integration Patterns**: External system connections

### Technical Specifications

- **Implementation Details**: Code structure and patterns
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, e2e test plans
- **Deployment Guide**: Infrastructure and CI/CD setup
- **Monitoring**: Logging, metrics, alerting configuration
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions

## Context Engineering Features

### Agent-Specific Context

- **Developer Context**: Technical implementation details
- **PM Context**: Business requirements and priorities
- **Architect Context**: System design and patterns
- **QA Context**: Testing requirements and criteria

### Dynamic Loading

- Load only relevant document fragments for current task
- Reduce context pollution and improve focus
- Maintain cross-references between related sections
- Support just-in-time knowledge retrieval

### Version Management

- Track changes across document fragments
- Merge conflict resolution for concurrent edits
- History preservation for audit trails
- Rollback capability for document sections

## M&A-Specific Sharding Examples

## Usage Instructions

1. **Upload Large Document**: Provide the document to be sharded
2. **Choose Strategy**: Select hierarchical, functional, or role-based sharding
3. **Configure Parameters**: Set fragment size limits and cross-reference rules
4. **Review Structure**: Validate the proposed sharding approach
5. **Execute Sharding**: Generate organized fragment collection
6. **Create Index**: Build searchable metadata for fragments
7. **Distribute Context**: Assign relevant fragments to appropriate agents

## Benefits for M&A Platform Development

### Improved Agent Performance

- Agents receive only relevant context for their tasks
- Reduced token usage and faster processing
- Better focus on specific problems
- More accurate and relevant outputs

### Enhanced Collaboration

- Multiple teams can work on different sections simultaneously
- Clear ownership and responsibility boundaries
- Reduced merge conflicts and coordination overhead
- Faster parallel development cycles

### Knowledge Management

- Searchable documentation fragments
- Reusable architectural patterns
- Version-controlled decision records
- Institutional knowledge preservation

## Command Examples

```
/shard-document "M&A_Platform_PRD.md" --strategy=functional --max-size=2000
/organize-knowledge --role=developer --focus=financial-modeling
/create-index --search-tags=api,security,compliance
