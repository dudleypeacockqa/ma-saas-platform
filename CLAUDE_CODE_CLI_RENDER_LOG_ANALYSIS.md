# Claude Code CLI Prompts for Render Log Analysis

**Analysis Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Platform**: "100 Days and Beyond" M&A Ecosystem  
**Issue**: Backend API 502 Bad Gateway Error  
**Tool**: Claude Code CLI with BMAD Method v6 Integration  
**Objective**: Systematic Log Analysis and Error Resolution  

## üîç **CLAUDE CODE CLI ACTIVATION SEQUENCE**

### **Primary Analysis Agent Activation**

Use the following command sequence in Claude Code CLI to activate the specialized analysis capabilities for Render log investigation:

```
/bmad:mmm:agents:architect
```

This activates the BMAD Architect Agent with specialized expertise in infrastructure analysis, deployment troubleshooting, and systematic error resolution with enterprise-grade quality standards.

### **Log Analysis Workflow Activation**

Once the Architect Agent is active, initiate the systematic analysis workflow:

```
/bmad:mmm:workflows:dev-story
```

This activates the development story workflow specifically configured for infrastructure troubleshooting and deployment optimization with comprehensive quality gates and validation procedures.

## üìã **SYSTEMATIC RENDER LOG ANALYSIS PROMPTS**

- Ensure enterprise-grade security and performance standards
- Maintain strategic alignment with ¬£200M wealth-building objective

Context: The frontend is operational at ma-saas-platform.onrender.com but backend API at ma-saas-backend.onrender.com returns 502 errors. The platform requires immediate resolution for customer acquisition and revenue generation.
```

### **Prompt 2: Environment Variable Configuration Analysis**

```
Examine the environment variable configuration for the Render backend deployment with focus on API integration requirements.

Required Environment Variables Analysis:
- CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY and CLERK_SECRET_KEY validation

- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for Claude MCP server integration
- DATABASE_URL for PostgreSQL vector database connection
- RENDER_API_KEY deployment status

Security Framework:
- Validate secure storage and transmission of sensitive keys
- Confirm proper environment variable deployment to Render
- Verify API key format and authentication requirements
- Ensure compliance with enterprise-grade security standards

Strategic Context: The comprehensive .env file exists locally with all required API keys including Render API (rnd_7cK6Tcaqek5sZ4WSZ5Y3Xqbq2hZ4). Analyze deployment status and provide systematic resolution for production environment activation.
```

### **Prompt 3: Database Connectivity and Migration Analysis**

```
Investigate PostgreSQL database connectivity issues and migration requirements for the multi-tenant M&A platform architecture.

Database Analysis Focus:
- PostgreSQL service provisioning status on Render
- Connection string format and accessibility validation
- Vector extension (pgvector) installation requirements
- Migration script execution status and error analysis
- Multi-tenant schema implementation verification

Performance Requirements:
- Sub-50ms query response time validation
- Connection pooling configuration optimization
- Index performance for semantic search capabilities
- Scalability planning for enterprise-grade operation

Technical Context: The platform requires PostgreSQL with vector extensions for AI-powered semantic search, partnership identification, and ecosystem intelligence. The migration script includes comprehensive multi-tenant schema with enterprise-grade security and performance optimization.
```

### **Prompt 4: FastAPI Application Startup Analysis**

```
Analyze the FastAPI application startup configuration and identify specific issues preventing successful service initialization.

Startup Analysis Areas:
- Python application entry point verification
- Dependency installation and version compatibility
- FastAPI configuration and middleware setup
- CORS configuration for frontend integration
- Health endpoint implementation and accessibility

Error Investigation:
- Application startup logs and error messages
- Import errors and dependency conflicts
- Configuration validation and environment setup
- Port binding and service accessibility issues
- Memory and resource allocation problems

Integration Requirements: The FastAPI application must integrate with Clerk authentication, Stripe payments, Claude MCP server, and PostgreSQL vector database while maintaining sub-200ms API response times and enterprise-grade security standards.
```

### **Prompt 5: Comprehensive Service Integration Validation**

```
Perform systematic validation of all third-party service integrations and identify specific configuration issues preventing operational status.

Integration Validation Framework:
- Clerk authentication service connectivity and configuration
- Stripe payment processing API integration and webhook setup
- Claude MCP server integration for AI-powered M&A capabilities
- PostgreSQL vector database connection and query execution
- Render service configuration and deployment optimization

Quality Assurance Requirements:
- API response time validation (target: <200ms)
- Security compliance verification (SOC 2 readiness)
- Error handling and logging implementation
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Business value confirmation and strategic alignment

Strategic Context: The platform must achieve operational status for immediate customer acquisition and revenue generation while maintaining competitive advantage over dealmakers.co.uk through superior technology integration and comprehensive service offerings.
```
