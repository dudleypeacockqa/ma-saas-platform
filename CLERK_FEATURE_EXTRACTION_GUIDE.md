## üéØ WHY WE NEED THIS

Currently, we have:

- ‚úÖ Correct pricing in Clerk and codebase
- ‚úÖ Correct plan IDs
- ‚ùå **Unknown:** Exact feature keys configured in Clerk
- ‚ùå **Unknown:** Which features are assigned to which plans

**The Risk:** Feature gating might not work correctly, allowing users to access features they shouldn't have.

## ‚ùì TROUBLESHOOTING

### Can't find "Features" section?

**Try this:**

1. Click on a plan in Clerk Dashboard
2. Look for sections named:
   - "Features"
   - "Included features"
   - "Plan features"
   - "Benefits"
   - "What's included"

### Features section is empty?

This means you haven't configured features yet in Clerk. You have two options:

**Option 1: Use our feature list (recommended)**
I'll provide you with a complete feature list to ADD to Clerk based on your pricing tiers.

**Option 2: Skip features**
You can skip feature-based gating and just use tier-based gating (less granular).

### Screenshot is too small to read?

**Use browser zoom:**

1. In Clerk Dashboard, press `Ctrl` + `+` (Windows) or `Cmd` + `+` (Mac)
2. Zoom to 150-200%
3. Take screenshot
4. Feature names should be clearly readable

---

## üí° WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

Once you provide the feature list:

1. **I will create:** `CLERK_FEATURE_REGISTRY.md` with master mapping
2. **I will update:** All 25 feature keys in code to match Clerk exactly
3. **I will align:** Frontend display, backend checks, documentation
4. **I will create:** Testing guide to verify each feature works
5. **Result:** Perfect BMAD alignment ‚Üí Clerk ‚Üî Codebase ‚Üî Docs

---

## ‚ö° QUICK START

**Fastest path:** Take 8 screenshots (one per plan) showing features section.

**Time:** 10 minutes
**Impact:** Ensures ¬£2.4M ARR system works correctly
**Risk if skipped:** Users might access premium features for free

---

**Ready when you are! Just share the screenshots or manual list.** üéØ
