# BMad Methodology Restoration & Implementation Guide

**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Phase:** Foundation Reset - BMad Workflow Recovery
**Objective:** Restore proper BMad methodology compliance and workflow structure

## üéØ BMad Methodology Recovery Status

**ISSUE IDENTIFIED:** The project abandoned structured BMad methodology in favor of ad-hoc development, resulting in:

- No proper phase transitions
- Missing validation checkpoints
- Unstructured agent interactions
- Documentation chaos
- Quality gate bypassing

**SOLUTION:** Restore full BMad methodology compliance with proper workflow structure.

## üìö BMad Methodology Overview (Restored)

### The 4-Phase BMad Approach

Based on `.claude/commands/bmad-orchestrator.md`, the proper methodology includes:

#### Phase 1: Analysis (Optional for established requirements)

- **Purpose**: Project discovery and requirements gathering
- **Output**: Product briefs, research artifacts, conceptual foundation
- **When**: New features, unclear requirements, market validation needed

#### Phase 2: Planning (Required for all projects)

- **Purpose**: Scale-adaptive project planning with automatic routing
- **Output**: PRDs, epics, technical specifications (scale-dependent)
- **When**: Every project - determines scope and next phase

#### Phase 3: Solutioning (Levels 3-4 Only)

- **Purpose**: Architecture design and technical planning
- **Output**: Architecture documentation, technical patterns
- **When**: Large projects (12+ stories, 2+ epics)

#### Phase 4: Implementation (Required for all projects)

- **Purpose**: Iterative development and delivery
- **Output**: Working software, tests, documentation
- **When**: All projects after planning/solutioning

### Step 1: Workflow Invocation

```bash
# Proper BMad workflow execution
/start-project "Project description"
/assess-scale "Determine project complexity"
/plan-feature "Create appropriate planning docs"
```

### Step 2: Phase Transition Validation

Before moving to next phase, ensure:

- [ ] Current phase deliverables complete
- [ ] Quality gates passed
- [ ] Stakeholder approval received
- [ ] Next phase prerequisites met

### Step 3: Agent Handoffs

- **Clean context transfer** between specialized agents
- **Document decisions** and rationale
- **Maintain traceability** through all phases
- **Validate handoff completeness**

## üìã Current Project Phase Assessment

### Historical Analysis

- **Planning**: Extensive documentation created
- **Solutioning**: Architecture documented
- **Implementation**: Substantial code written but not validated

**Missing BMad compliance:**

- No proper phase transitions
- No quality gate validation
- No agent specialization adherence
