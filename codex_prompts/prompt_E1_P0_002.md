# BMAD v6 Codex Prompt: E1.P0.002 - Implement User Registration with Clerk Integration

## üéØ Story Context

- Epic: Customer Onboarding
- Priority: P0 - CRITICAL
- Size: M (2-3 days)
- Sprint: 1 (2025-10-14 ‚Üí 2025-10-20)

## üë§ User Story

As a New user wanting to access the platform, I want to create an account and verify email via Clerk, so that I can access the platform features and start using the service.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

Given I am on the landing page and click 'Sign Up', when I complete the registration form, then I receive verification email and can access my dashboard, and:

- Form enforces password strength
- Email verification fires instantly
- User record synced to internal DB
- Unverified users cannot access protected routes

## üîß Implementation Guidelines

### Frontend

# Use React Hook Form + Zod for validation

# Handle submission, error, and success states

# Provide user feedback (loading, toasts)

### Backend

# Add webhook handler under backend/app/api/...

# Validate signatures/secrets before processing

# Persist events and trigger downstream actions

# Update authentication middleware / dependencies

# Handle Clerk webhook events for user sync

# Enforce role/permission checks as required

### Integrations

# Configure Clerk SDK and environment variables

# Test registration/login/logout flows

# Verify webhook processing and user sync

# Configure AI service API keys and client

# Test prompt/response flow, handle errors

# Add streaming responses where needed

# Configure email provider (SendGrid/Resend)

# Validate template rendering and delivery

# Monitor email metrics/logs

## üõ†Ô∏è Execution Steps
