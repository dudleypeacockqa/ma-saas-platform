# BMad Documentation Standards - Implementation Guide

**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Phase:** Foundation Reset - Documentation Framework
**Objective:** Establish BMad-compliant documentation standards to prevent future chaos

## üéØ Documentation Standards Overview

**PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:** Documentation chaos led to contradictory claims, methodology violations, and project confusion.

**ROOT CAUSE:** No standardized documentation process or quality control for status reporting.

**SOLUTION:** Implement comprehensive BMad documentation standards with quality gates and approval processes.

## üìö BMad Documentation Framework

### Core Documentation Principles

#### 1. Truth and Accuracy

- **No Aspirational Claims**: Only document what has been verified and validated
- **Evidence-Based**: All claims must be supported by demonstrable evidence
- **Honest Assessment**: Include both achievements and limitations
- **Regular Validation**: Documentation must be regularly updated to reflect reality

#### 2. BMad Methodology Compliance

- **Phase-Appropriate**: Documentation must match current BMad phase
- **Agent Specialization**: Only specialists create domain-specific documentation
- **Quality Gates**: Documentation review required before publication
- **Traceability**: Clear lineage from requirements through implementation

#### 3. Clarity and Consistency

- **Standardized Formats**: All documents follow approved templates
- **Clear Ownership**: Every document has a designated owner and reviewer
- **Version Control**: All changes tracked with rationale
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Documentation serves specific audience needs

## üìã Document Categories and Standards

## üö´ Prohibited Documentation Practices

### Strictly Forbidden

- **Completion Claims Without Evidence**: Never claim something is "done" without proof
- **Aspirational Status Reports**: No "ready for launch" without actual readiness
- **Contradictory Documentation**: Multiple documents claiming different states
- **Unvalidated Technical Claims**: No performance or capability claims without testing
- **Agent Role Violations**: Specialists cannot create documentation outside their expertise

### Documentation Violations and Consequences

- **First Violation**: Document retraction and correction required
- **Second Violation**: Mandatory BMad methodology retraining
- **Third Violation**: Documentation privileges suspended
