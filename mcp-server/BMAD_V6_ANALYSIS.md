# BMAD v6 Architecture Analysis for MCP Server Implementation

## Executive Summary

Based on analysis of the official BMAD-METHOD v6-alpha repository, this document outlines the architectural principles and implementation requirements for building a centralized MCP server that follows BMAD v6 specifications for our M&A SaaS platform.

## BMAD v6 Core Innovations

### 1. Collaboration Optimized Reflection Engine (C.O.R.E.)

BMAD v6 introduces a fundamental shift from traditional AI task automation to **human amplification through guided collaboration**:

- **Collaboration**: Human-AI partnership where both contribute unique strengths
- **Optimized**: Refined collaborative processes for maximum effectiveness
- **Reflection**: Guided thinking that helps discover better solutions
- **Engine**: Framework orchestrating specialized agents and workflows

### 2. Scale-Adaptive Workflow Engine™

The v6 system automatically adapts workflows based on project complexity (Level 0-4):

| Level | Scope                    | Outputs                        | Implementation Phase       |
| ----- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| 0     | Single atomic change     | tech-spec + 1 story            | Direct to Implementation   |
| 1     | 1-10 stories, 1 epic     | tech-spec + epic + 2-3 stories | Direct to Implementation   |
| 2     | 5-15 stories, 1-2 epics  | Focused PRD + tech-spec        | Direct to Implementation   |
| 3     | 12-40 stories, 2-5 epics | Full PRD + Epics list          | Requires Solutioning Phase |
| 4     | 40+ stories, 5+ epics    | Enterprise PRD + Epics         | Requires Solutioning Phase |

## MCP Server Architecture Requirements

### 1. Agent-as-Code Implementation

BMAD v6 implements agents as **self-contained markdown files with embedded YAML configurations**:

```yaml
# Agent Configuration Example
name: 'bmad-analyst'
description: 'Business analysis and requirements gathering specialist'
author: 'BMad Core'
communication_language: 'English'
persona: 'Strategic business analyst with M&A expertise'
```

**MCP Server Requirement**: Support dynamic agent loading from markdown files with YAML frontmatter.

### 2. Workflow Orchestration System

BMAD v6 uses a sophisticated workflow system with:

- **Universal Entry Point**: `workflow-status` checks project state
- **State Machine Management**: BACKLOG → TODO → IN PROGRESS → DONE
- **Just-In-Time Design**: Technical specs created per epic during implementation
- **Dynamic Context Injection**: Story-specific expertise provided via XML

**MCP Server Requirement**: Implement workflow state persistence and orchestration engine.

### 3. Module System Architecture

BMAD v6 organizes functionality into modules:

```
bmad/
├── _cfg/                 # Configuration and manifests
├── core/                 # Core orchestration agents
├── bmm/                  # BMad Method Module (software development)
├── bmb/                  # BMad Builder (agent creation)
└── cis/                  # Creative Intelligence Suite
```

**MCP Server Requirement**: Support modular architecture with cross-module dependencies.

### 4. Configuration Management

BMAD v6 uses centralized configuration:

```yaml
# core-config.yaml
user_name: 'BMad'
communication_language: 'English'
output_folder: '{project-root}/docs'
```

**MCP Server Requirement**: Centralized configuration management with environment-specific overrides.
