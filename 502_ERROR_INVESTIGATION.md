\_# 502 Bad Gateway Error Investigation

**Date**: October 11, 2025  
**Platform**: "100 Days and Beyond" M&A Ecosystem  
**Issue**: Backend API 502 Bad Gateway Error

## 1. Initial Assessment

The backend service at `ma-saas-backend.onrender.com` is returning a 502 Bad Gateway error. This indicates that Render's load balancer is unable to get a response from the application. The frontend is operational, suggesting the issue is isolated to the backend service.

## 2. Potential Causes

Based on a review of the project files, the following are the most likely causes of the 502 error:

- **Application Startup Failure**: The FastAPI application may be crashing during startup due to a variety of reasons, including:
  - **Missing Environment Variables**: The `render.yaml` file specifies several environment variables with `sync: false`, which must be manually set in the Render dashboard. The application may be failing if it depends on these variables at startup.
  - **Incorrect Database Configuration**: The application may be unable to connect to the PostgreSQL database.
  - **Code Errors**: There may be unhandled exceptions in the application code that are causing it to crash.
- **Incorrect Port Binding**: The application may not be listening on the port specified by the `PORT` environment variable provided by Render.
- **Health Check Failures**: The health check defined in the `Dockerfile` and `render.yaml` may be failing, causing Render to terminate the instance.
- **Configuration Discrepancies**: There are two `render.yaml` files in the project, which could lead to confusion and misconfiguration.

## 3. Investigation Plan

I will follow a systematic approach to diagnose and resolve the issue:

1.  **Configuration Analysis**: I will analyze the `render.yaml` files and the `Dockerfile` to identify any inconsistencies or potential misconfigurations.
2.  **Environment Variable Verification**: I will cross-reference the environment variables defined in the `render.yaml` file with the application code to determine which variables are critical for startup.
3.  **Log Analysis**: I will search for application logs from Render to identify the specific error that is causing the startup failure.
4.  **Code Review**: I will review the application startup code in `app/main.py` to understand how it handles configuration and dependencies.
5.  **Resolution and Verification**: Based on my findings, I will propose a solution, apply the necessary fixes, and verify that the backend service is operational.

## 4. Next Steps

My immediate next step is to analyze the `render.yaml` files to clarify the deployment configuration. I will then proceed to investigate the environment variables and application logs.
